Static data includes foundational information that doesn't change during gameplay, such as team names, logos, branding colors, player profiles, and tournament details.

## What is static data?

Static data is information about an entity that is not affected by live in-game events. Unlike in-game data that updates as a series plays, static data remains constant throughout a competition.

Examples of static data include:
- Team names and organization details
- Team logos and branding colors
- Tournament titles and formats
- Player names and biographical information
- Team rosters during a series
- Content catalogs (e.g. characters, maps, weapons, etc.)
