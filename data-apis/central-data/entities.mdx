Series, players, teams, titles and tournaments are the primary entities in the Central Data API.

## Relationships
Entities in the Central Data API are interconnected and can be represented as nodes in a graph. The relationship between entities is denoted by edges. Additional information about the relationship is included in the relationship fields (for example, `scoreAdvantage` for a team participant relationship on the series entity).

For example, in a best-of-three series between C9 White and G2 Gozen for Valorant Game Changers, a Series entity can be linked to several other entities to obtain their respective data.

## Series
A Series represents a minimum of one game played by two teams in a tournament context. The Series entity in the Central Data API does not track in-game events. Instead, it records data points related to scheduling, context, and format.
#### Related entity: Series format
The format of a series determines the number of games played and how the winner is determined. For example, BO1 and BO3 formats (respectively, "best-of-1" and "best-of-3") indicate that one or up to three games are played. The winner of a BO1 series wins with one game, and the winner of a BO3 series wins with two games.
#### Related entity: Product service level
The service level indicates the type of coverage GRID offers for a given series in each product. The value of this field can be `FULL`, `LIMITED`, or `NONE`.
#### Related entity: Video stream
The video stream entity provides the URL for a series's live video stream.
#### Related entity: External links
The external links entity provides information external IDs for a series. For example the corresponding Riot IDs for Valorant or League of Legends series.   

## Teams
Teams identify groups of players participating in games.
#### Related entity: Team participant
You can find this entity in Series. It contains the information of the team, alongside the score advantage for a given series.

## Players
Players represent the individuals participating in games. The Central Data API uses this entity to keep track of players between different matches consistently.

## Titles
Titles describe the games supported by GRID. For example, Valorant, CS:GO, and DotA are supported titles. Titles play an important role in defining the Central Data API. While all GRID APIs are title-agnostic, events and states may have small differences between titles to express the game state fully.

## Tournaments
Tournaments are a collection of series in which teams participate towards a final goal. Tournaments can be organized in a single event or over multiple events and can be nested within each other.
Example: The Valorant Game Changers tournament is a collection of tournaments that are played under the same umbrella. Within that tournbament there are several events, each with their own series such as Game Changers NA, Game Changers EU etc.
