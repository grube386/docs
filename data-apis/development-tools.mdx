GRID provides development tools to help you interact with our APIs. Use these tools to check what is available, get started quickly, or reference information.

## GraphQL Playground
To discover and test different GraphQL queries across GRID APIs, use the [GraphQL Playground](https://portal.grid.gg/documentation/graphql-playground). This tool allows live queries for real data. You can view the schema for each API using the panel on the right side of the playground.

## Data Feed Viewer
Use the [Data Feed Viewer](https://dashboard.grid.gg/developers/feed-viewer) to discover the events data contained within transactions, published by the [Series Events API](/documentation/api-reference/live-data-feed/series-events-api).
