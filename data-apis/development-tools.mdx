GRID provides development tools to help you interact with our APIs. These help you with checking what is available, making the first steps or serve as a quick reference.

## GraphQL Playground
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a language that enables a flexible approach to querying APIs, by enabling the 
client to query only what is required. Most APIs offered as part of the GRID data feeds are queryable with GraphQL.

In order to discover and test different GraphQL queries across these APIs, the [_GraphQL Playground_](https://portal.grid.gg/documentation/graphql-playground) 
is available that allows live queries for real data. It is possible to view the schema for each API using the panel 
located on the right-hand side of the playground application.


## Data Feed Viewer
The [Data Feed Viewer](https://dashboard.grid.gg/developers/feed-viewer) enables consumers to discover the events data 
contained within transactions, published by the [Series Events API](/documentation/api-reference/live-data-feed/series-events-api).
