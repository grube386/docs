## Welcome on the GRID
GRID provides competitive gaming data through APIs. The data is split up in:

- **Static data**: schedules, tournaments, teams, ... 
- **In-game data**: gameplay data, updated as a series is played

The documentation is here to:

- Help you interact with our APIs as quickly as possible
  - Go to our [Static Data Quick-Start Guide](/central-data/quick-start)
  - Go to our [In-Game Data Quick-Start Guide](/documentation/api-documentation/in-game-data/live-data-feed-quick-start-guide)
- Explain how our APIs are designed
- Provide you with a complete view of what is available
  - Go to our [API Reference](/documentation/api-reference/getting-started/overview)
- Provide you with examples of how to use the APIs 

Use the table of contents on the left to explore further.
